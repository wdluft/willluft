"Become by doing" has become the primary expression for myself to try and live by. For the past few years, I've been on the hunt for a simple phrase or expression to live by. I've tried a bunch of different ones, none really stuck with me. I'll reference them occasionally when doing some thinking about how I can be a better person, but I don't think of them every day. I don't remember the exact date I came up with this new expression, but I think it's been a couple months already.

What you do and how you do it is a choice. Not doing something is a choice to not take action. Not giving something your full attention and effort is a choice you make. You become something by doing (or not doing) that thing repeatedly. You become an athlete by playing sports. You become a web developer by building websites. You become lazy by not putting effort into the things you need to do.

In _Batman Begins_, Batman says "Itâ€™s not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me." One of the beatiful parts of life is the ability for you to shape it. "Become by doing" is a reminder that I'm actively defining who I am by what I do every day. It's an iterative process to working towards becoming the best I can be. It's inevitable that I'll do things I shouldn't, but I always have the opportunity to start doing what I need to do again.

Using this phrase as the title of my blog is a way I can further ingrain it into my life. It's inspiring to know that I have this potential to become what I set my mind to. And I need constant reminders to keep going because life can be challenging. Each day is an opportunity to try and be a bit better than the day before. I'm becoming the person I want to be by doing things every day.
