I used to write a lot more than I do now. I'd write about the books I read, how my day went, and other thoughts and ideas that caught my mind. I've lost count of the number of blogs I've had across the years, moving from Blogspot/Blogger from Google to Wordpress. Writing a great way to solidify your thoughts and help you work through problems. And it's something I want to do more.
</br>
</br>
I could've easily reverted to one of my old blogs, but I'm working on becoming a web developer and thought building my own would be a great way to put my skills into practice. I first started learning web development a little over two years ago and I've learned that making your own projects is the best way to strengthen the skills I've learned.
</br>
</br>
I first started on this project thinking I would use <a href='https://www.meteor.com' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'>Meteor</a> as the platform, since it simplifies a lot of the backend code that I'm not very familiar with. It used MongoDB as a database and React as the front-end library. One thing I was really excited about was being able to set it up so only a logged in user to create a new post, but not allow new users to register. I was able to get it to work, but I wasn't very excited about the cost of having to host it. This was something I should have looked into before starting, but this gave me some practice and a lot of stuff would be able to be reused. I made the <a href='https://github.com/wdluft/simple-meteorjs-blog' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'>Github repo for this project</a> public since I decided to go a different route. Maybe someone will find it helpful.
</br>
</br>
After looking at other options, I decided to use <a href='https://www.gatsbyjs.org/' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'>Gatsby</a> to build a static site using React on the front-end. I followed the <a href='https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/pro-gatsby-2' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'>Pro Gatsby 2 tutorial</a> by LevelUpTutorials to learn the basics of how Gatsby worked. I was pleasantly surprised to learn the project in the tutorial was also a simple blog. I ended up taking the design in a bit of a different way, but it has pretty similar functionality. It simply uses a folder of markdown files as the blog posts, eliminating the need for a server. I was also able to use a lot of the components I created in the original project, which helped cut down the time needed to create the finished project.
</br>
</br>
That's how I ended up here, writing this first post. You can look at the code powering this site on the <a href='https://github.com/wdluft/become-by-doing-blog' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'>Github repo</a>. I really like the color scheme and plan to update my personal site to match. It feels good to be writing again and I hope to do more in the next few weeks. Until next time, cheers!
