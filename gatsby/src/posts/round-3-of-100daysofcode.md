Last week wrapped up the third time I've completed the #100DaysOfCode challenge. For those not familiar, it is a challenge to spend at least 30 minutes to an hour a day coding for 100 days. Ideally the days are all in a row, but sometimes life gets in the way. I like to start my year off with this challenge to make sure I'm putting in the time consistently to practice and learn. As always, there was a lot of focus on learning new things.
</br>
</br>
In the Fall of 2019, I signed up for a <a href='https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'>Level Up Tutorials Pro subscription</a>. this granted me access to a ton of tutorials and courses. I went through a lot during this year's challenge, but here are some of my favorites:
</br>

- <a href='https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/pro-gatsby-2' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'>Pro Gatsby 2</a>
- <a href='https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/level-2-meteor-react' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'>Level 2 Meteor + React</a>
- <a href='https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/custom-react-hooks' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'>Custom React Hooks</a>
- <a href='https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/animating-react-with-framer-motion' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'>Animating React with Framer Motion</a>
- <a href='https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/design-systems-in-figma' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'>Design Systems in Figma</a>

</br>
I used what I learned from the Pro Gatsby 2 course to build both this blog and rebuild my <a href='https://willluft.com/' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'></a>portfolio site. I recently finished the Animating React with Framer Motion course and I'm thinking about all the ways I can add subtle animations to my projects. Even though the Pro subscription isn't cheap, you get a ton of value for your money.
</br>
</br>
I also bought a few of Wes Bos's courses to strengthen my web development skills. I did his <a href='https://beginnerjavascript.com/' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'>Beginner JavaScript course</a> (<a href='https://becomebydoing.me/posts/back-to-basics-beginner-javascript' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'>which I wrote about here</a>), <a href='https://cssgrid.io/' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'>CSS Grid course</a>, and <a href='https://learnnode.com/' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'>Learn Node course</a>. The Beginner JavaScript course is an invaluable resource to strengthen the fundamental skills that can be built upon and I plan on going back to it whenever I need some review. The CSS Grid course was another great point of review and was a tremendous help for thinking about how to create layouts.
</br>
</br>
I found <a href='https://www.frontendmentor.io/' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'>Frontend Mentor</a> in the last few weeks of the challenge and I put a lot of time into a few of the challenges there. I really like the service because it forced me to try and copy a design without following along to a guide. I can get caught up in following tutorials and doing code alongs that I don't get as much practice as I should building things without copying. It's a great way to practice skills you learn from tutorials by providing a design to try and replicate.
</br>
</br>
Another big focus of this year's challenge was design. Looking at the projects I built last year, they didn't look great. They were flat, had poor color and spacing choices, and not very appealing. I knew I wanted to step up my design skills, and I learned a ton from purchasing <a href='https://refactoringui.com/' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'>Refactoring UI by Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger</a>. Their book showed me how to use elevation to great affect, and how to pick a color palette that works together. As mentioned before, the Design Systems in Figma course from LevelUpTutorials was another great resource that showed how to build a system from scratch to use as a guide for building a new project.
</br>
</br>
Armed with these new design basics, I redesigned, rebuilt, and refactored all my projects. I cleaned up a lot of code and updated the websites so they aren't complete eyesores. I really enjoyed going back to old projects and trimming down my old code. Even though I worked on most of these projects in the past year, I could easily go back to remove a lot of unnecessary stuff. It's tangible evidence of my skills improving over time and really exciting to see.
</br>
</br>
Looking back, I learned a lot throughout this year's #100DaysOfCode challenge. More importantly, I took what I learned and put it into practice. It's easy to get trapped thinking you're improving just by coding along to tutorials, but you don't know how much you're really learning until you build something yourself. The #100DaysOfCode challenge is my favorite way to push myself to consistently practice my web development skills because it forces me to publicly show what I'm doing and gives me lots of opportunities to try new things. I highly recommend giving it a go, whether you're just starting out, or have a lot of experience. It provides the chance to learn something new and you might find something you really enjoy.
