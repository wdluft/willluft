As much as I want to like meditating, it's never worked out how I've wanted. I've tried a few different times over the past few years to get into a daily practice with different methods. From guided meditation apps, to sitting alone with music trying to focus on my breath, to sitting without any special noise trying to focus on the breath, I end up getting caught up thinking. I looked for the suggested benefits, like reduced stress, relaxing my mind, and (when done in the morning) starting the day off with a clear head, but it never seemed to do much for me. But I recently learned that I find these things not from sitting still, but by getting up and going out for a walk.

For the past couple of weeks, my days are almost always better when I get up early enough to start my day off with a walk around the block. The combination of the fresh morning air and the movement of my body accomplish all the things I was looking at meditation to do. I'm a pretty restless person, and walking helps calm me down when I'm stressed.

The most challenging part of the meditation practices I tried were the releasing of thoughts or the goal of not letting thoughts capture your focus. I'd catch myself thinking, and then mentally scold myself for it, which is another thought itself. Walking instead becomes a time either specifically for thinking and working things out in my head or just to experience some stillness in my life. I don't have to worry about any texts or emails or any work, I can just appreciate what is right in front of me.

In his book, _Stillness is the Key_, Ryan Holiday has an entire chapter dedicated to walking. He says "It's not about anything...Walk away from the thoughts that need to be walked away from; walk toward the ones that have now appeared". Walks can be used to try and work out a problem, or to let go of whatever is occupying your mind and letting new things in.

Taking a walk is growing to be one of my most enjoyable and helpful parts of my days. Whether it is in the morning before I start my work or if it is when I'm feeling very stressed and heightened emotions, getting up for a walk does wonders for my mental health.
