---

I've been learning web development for a couple years at this point, but I still feel like I have a lot to learn. It's a skill I try to build every day and I've gone through a bunch of different tutorials and courses. I can confidently say that <a href='https://beginnerjavascript.com/' rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank'>Wes Bos's Beginner JavaScript course</a> is one of the best I've done.
</br>
</br>
One thing that really stood out to me about this course was how Wes intentionally left in mistakes in his code that broke what he was trying to do. He demonstrates how to debug your code and figure out why it isn't doing what you think it should be doing. Leaving out those mistakes would leave out one of the most important parts of learning how to code - figuring out what you did wrong and how to go about fixing it.
</br>
</br>
This course provides some of the best examples of traversing the DOM I've seen. Starting with just showing all the different ways you can access DOM elements, Wes uses different methods of accessing elements and adding elements to the DOM throughout the projects.
</br>
</br>
Wes also tries to use real-life examples whenever possible. He doesn't use arbitrary variable names like 'foo' or 'bar', but names them like you would in a real project. Some of the projects include building an etch a sketch, building a photo gallery, currency converter, and more. Some projects are built once, and then refactored later on once more concepts are introduced to show how there isn't just one way to do something. One of the projects was how to work with tabs, which is something I've been thinking about how to implement for a website I'm working on. Wes explains things with as little jargon as he can and does a fantastic job of showing how the things he's teaching can be used in a ton of different ways.
</br>
</br>
Whether you're just starting to learn how to code or you've got some experience under your belt, but want to strengthen your skills, this course is well worth the price. It's clear Wes loves teaching and put his heart into producing this course and the content is some of the best around.
